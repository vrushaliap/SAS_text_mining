The scenario is between two vehicles. The situation is quite critical as the weather is not that good and the streets are dark as some road work is going on at the junction-roundabout.

The two vehicles are a Range Rover, let us call it 1, and the other is an SUV. Let's call it 2.

Both drivers are in their late 20s. It was a Saturday night. They were both going back home after having dinner at a restaurant around 8:30 p.m.

It was raining and windy. The road they both took had some work in progress. As the winds were strong, there was light cut out in the area.

Apart from that, both drivers were within their speed limit, and the condition of the road was nice for all the roads except for the roundabout area.

Also, both drivers did not drink as they had to drive back home.

Both cars have airbags and are designed in such a way that they can prevent accidents.

Regarding the other condition, the help center is nearby, there are zebra crossings, signals are working perfectly fine, and due to the night, the road is not that busy.
